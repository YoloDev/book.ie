    <h1 chapter="i"><strong>Prologue</strong> Is it Wrong to Expect for Encounters in the Dungeon?</h1>
    <div class="fullpage"><img src="http://solitarytranslation.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/01_003.jpg" /></div>
    <p>There is a seemingly infinite dungeon with many and many floors. Inside there are a variety of heinous monsters.</p>
    <p>I, together with those adventurers seeking fame and fortune and risking their own lives, registered my own name at the guild, and then began to adventure.</p>
    <p>With a sword in my own hand and swiftly emerge abruptly. Then in the end, I would have an encounter with a girl that has been attacked by those monsters.</p>
    <p>Endless Screams. The monster’s savage roars. Just in the nick of time, suddenly the sound of a swift and sharp sword, piercing through the air, would emerge.</p>
    <p>The monster was defeated. What was left was the beautiful girl remaining seated on the ground, while I stand gloriously.</p>
    <p>Her cheeks would be slightly dyed red, and in those beautiful, tearful eyes, what was projected was only my appearance. A faint love will awaken in her heart.</p>
    <p>At times I would talk to the cute shop personnel in a restaurant about my adventures that day, forming a closer relationship.</p>
    <p>At times I would protect a female elf from savage adventurers.</p>
    <p>At times I would also lend assistance to the Amazon warriors when they were in trouble, forming a party together to adventure.</p>
    <p>At times I would get too close towards a girl,and the other girls that witnessed it would be jealous.</p>
    <p>At times At times At times At times……</p>
    <p>This was a completely normal way of thinking for a male child, who grew up aspiring towards the heroic adventure.</p>
    <p>Wanting to have a closer relationship with cute girls. Wanting to interact with beautiful ladies from a different race.</p>
    <p>Holding to this somewhat improper, or perhaps immature thoughts. Isn’t this a normal personality for a young male?</p>
    <p>Can’t I have an encounter in the dungeon, correction, search for a harem, is this really wrong?</p>
    <p>Conclusion:</p>
    <p>I was completely wrong.</p>
    <p>“Wuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah”</p>
    <p>“Huaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah”</p>
    <p>I guess this is the result for an adventurer like me who is holding such improper and immature thoughts. I, am about to die.</p>
    <p>To be more precise, I am currently being chased by a monster with a human body and a bull’s head, a “Minotaur”.</p>
    <p>This monster was completely immune to my attacks, who was only level 1. I was about to be eaten by it.</p>
    <p>I entered a dead end. That’s right, I was at death’s door.</p>
    <p>So this is my fate for being obsessed with such a shallow delusion, becoming a monster’s food, I am such a fool.</p>
    <p>I am such a fool for expecting a fateful encounter.</p>
    <p>The idea of becoming rich and getting a crowd of wives and concubines was naturally just a dream.</p>
    <p>At the instant when I first began to prepare and search for an encounter in the dungeon where numerous people die daily, I was already finished.</p>
    <p>Ah, I really want to go back! Go back to the time and punch the me, who had just become of age and was signing the registration document with sparking eyes at the guild.</p>
    <p>No matter from what physical angle or from the angle of my fate, these things were already impossible.</p>
    <p>“Vuumun”</p>
    <p>“Huh”?</p>
    <p>The Minotaur’s hoof.</p>
    <p>Although it did not directly kick my back, every step it takes crushes the earth,so even the location where I was standing was being affected by the impacts.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t able to stand still and could only roll around the floor of the dungeon.</p>
    <p>“Fuuah”</p>
    <p>“Uwaaaaah”</p>
    <p>I would actually be sitting on the floor, when my life tragically ends.</p>
    <p>The wish of encountering cute girls would be completely destroyed. Looks like from the very beginning, I did not have the qualifications to become a hero from the fairy tales.</p>
    <p>My back hit the wall. There was no path to retreat.</p>
    <p>It passed through dozens of paths and finally managed to chase after me. Forcing me into this square-shaped space.</p>
    <p>(Ah…! I’m dead.)</p>
    <p>My teeth constantly chattered, tears also flowed down in torrents.</p>
    <p>My own skin could completely feel the deep and heavy breath exuded from the Minotaur.</p>
    <p>Raising my head and staring at the muscular body that was one to two times larger than me. As if I completely gave up, my face expressed an completely disgusting slight smile.</p>
    <p>——In the end, I did not have an encounter with a girl.</p>
    <p>Just as my unrepenting brain spouted these incorrigible thoughts that drove me to my death, the Minotaur that was slowly waving his hoof appeared in front of my eyes.</p>
    <p>In the next instant, a line passed through the monster’s body.</p>
    <p>“Eeeh?”</p>
    <p>“Vuo”</p>
    <p>Those were the dumb sounds issued by me and the Minotaur.</p>
    <p>The flowing line did not just pass through the body, it also ran through the thick chest, hoof, then the upper wrist, thighs, lower body, shoulders and finally ran to the next, all in one go.</p>
    <p>At the end, I could only see a silver light.</p>
    <p>The result was, the monster that I completely could not phase, instantly turned into pieces of meat.</p>
    <p>“Gubuh?!Vuaaaaaaaah….”</p>
    <p>Painful screams echoed throughout the room before its death.</p>
    <p>Following the carved lines, the Minotaur’s body also fell down in parts. Along with the blood spraying out, the dark red liquid gushed out, it completely collapsed in the next moment.</p>
    <p>A large amount of blood spattered onto my body, as if I had taken a shower. I was completely frozen stiff.</p>
    <p>“Are you alright”?</p>
    <div class="fullpage"><img src="http://solitarytranslation.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/01_008.jpg" /></div>
    <p>What came after the bull-headed monster was a girl that could have been mistaken for a goddess.</p>
    <p>Her slender body was wrapped in blue lightweight armor.</p>
    <p>The flexible limbs, that extended out from her clothes, were also dazzlingly beautiful.</p>
    <p>Considering her slim soft body, her chest was abnormally filled based on my opinion. Wearing an emblem on her silver breastplate, and the same colored gloves and accessories also bore an emblem. Blood was trickling down from the tip of her sword that was pointing to the ground.</p>
    <p>Her blond hair extended straight down to her shoulders, it held a shine that would not lose to a large amount of golden treasures.</p>
    <p>On top of having a body that other females would be jealous of, she had a very cute baby face that everyone would like.</p>
    <p>The color of her eyes , that looked at me, was also golden.</p>
    <p>(……)</p>
    <p>——A blonde swordsman wrapped in blue equipment with golden eyes.</p>
    <p>Even I, who was still only a Level 1 and a novice adventurer, knew who the person in front of me was.</p>
    <p>It was a top adventurer belonging to the &lt;Loki Familia&gt;</p>
    <p>Among the human, no, even among the females of all the races, she would be considered to be one of the strongest as a Level 5.</p>
    <p>&lt;Sword Princess&gt; Aizu Wallenstein.</p>
    <p>“Excuse me….are you alright?”</p>
    <p>I’m not alright.</p>
    <p>I’m not alright at all.</p>
    <p>To my heart that was currently constantly jumping, as if it was about to shatter, you cannot consider it alright at all.</p>
    <p>My cheeks were dyed red, and the tearful eyes that were projecting the figure of the other party, a faint…no, a strong love was awakening.</p>
    <p>My wild ideas became real, the roles were reversed, and my thoughts had reached the summit.</p>
    <p>At that moment, she had stolen my heart.</p>
    <p>Was asking for a chance encounter in the dungeon wrong?</p>
    <p>Re-conclusion:</p>
    <p>I was definitely not wrong.</p>

    <h1 chapter="1"><strong>Chapter 1</strong> The World, Reality and Aspirations</h1>
    <div class="fullpage"><img src="http://solitarytranslation.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/01_011.jpg" /></div>
    <p>“Einaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p>
    <p>“Eh?”</p>
    <p>As a window receptionist of the dungeon management, Eina Tulle shifted her focus from the book in her hand and lifted up her head.</p>
    <p>She had a pair of slender pointy ears and clear emerald-colored eyes. Her shoulder-length brown hair had a beautiful sheen. This beautiful appearance is not the same type as the elves that seemed to be pure and flawless, but rather a natural type. She was wearing a guild uniform on her slim body, a black top pants of the same color, making her extremely beautiful.</p>
    <p>Her disposition as a professional woman made others feel that she was quite approachable. The truth is that this young female was a mix between a human and an elf.</p>
    <p>As a receptionist, her afternoon wasn’t too busy since the adventurers were basically all inside the dungeon at that time. So there will be some spare time for her to read books. She lifted her head and noticed who had called her.</p>
    <p>(Looks like he was safe today as well…)</p>
    <p>It was something that occurred almost two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>At that time, that young boy, with shining eyes, came to the guild to go through the procedures.</p>
    <p>She was acting as an adviser for dungeon strategy. That boy was still only 14 years old, and although “Adventurer” is a job that did not ask for race, nor their gender and age, but in this profession, many people die accidentally. At his age, he is still a child. But he deliberately rushed into such a dangerous area and she did not know what expression she gave him at that time.</p>
    <p>Maybe it was because she was responsible for him, but Eina missed that kid from time to time. When she confirmed that the boy was still alive, her face eased slightly. She remembered that he was called Bell Cranel.</p>
    <p>She lifted up her glasses and turned her head towards the source of the voice.</p>
    <p>“Einaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”</p>
    <p>A figure of a boy covered with black blood appeared in her field of vision.</p>
    <p>“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?”</p>
    <p>“Please tell me Aizu Wallenstein’s information!”</p>
    <p class="centered">× × ×</p>
    <p>“Bell-kun, you… If you are stained with blood when you return, you should at least first take a shower…”</p>
    <p>“Sorry…”</p>
    <p>Listening to Eina, I bowed down my head in embarrassment.</p>
    <p>We are currently inside a small room that is separated specially within the guild hall.</p>
    <p>Eina and I sat facing each other and were separated by a table.</p>
    <p>On the opposite of me, who had just cleaned up his body, Eina apparently sighed.</p>
    <p>“You actually were able to bring that bloody smell and absolutely horrifying appearance directly across the streets from the dungeon to here. I really have doubts about your brain.”</p>
    <p>“About this.”</p>
    <p>After that was said by the beautiful Eina, my heart seemed to have been stabbed by a knife. Tears also emerged in my eyes.</p>
    <p>Eina gave a wry smile, pointed a finger at my nose, smiled and said: “You should pay better attention next time, okay?” Yes Yes, I nodded heavily.</p>
    <p>“Also next is… you just said you wanted information about Aizu Wallenstein right. Why?”</p>
    <p>“Mm, about this…”</p>
    <p>My face flushed before I explained the thing.</p>
    <p>I had dashed down to the fifth floor from the second floor where I usually stayed.</p>
    <p>The instant that I had entered I met a Minotaur and was being chased by it.</p>
    <p>Just when I was forced into a dead end, I was saved by the &lt;Sword Princess&gt; Aizu Wallenstein.</p>
    <p>At the time I was still very unstable, and just when I was preparing to say my thanks, the instant I saw she held out her hand, my head went blank —— A swelling sense of shame and nervousness confused me —— and I immediately rushed away at full speed.</p>
    <p>While listening beside me, Eina’s appearance changed more and more as she followed my words.</p>
    <p>“—— Ah, why did you not follow what I said! You not only entered the dungeon by yourself, but you also stubbornly went to the lower floors! Didn’t I tell you many times? Taking risks is absolutely, ABSOLUTELY, not allowed!”</p>
    <p>“Yesss…”</p>
    <p>————&lt;Adventurers must not go on an adventure&gt;————</p>
    <p>This was Eina’s opening statement. Although judging from the text it may seem contradictory, but its true meaning is that &lt;You must always be careful and well-prepared and you must always place safety as priority&gt;.</p>
    <p>Especially for a newcomer like me, it is something that I must always bear in mind, because this stage is where the most deaths occur in an adventurer’s career.</p>
    <p>Meeting a LV. 2 Minotaur on the fifth floor is something that no one can imagine.</p>
    <p>From common knowledge, this monster should only come out from the fifteenth floor or below. Eina said this had a feeling of “Did something happen in the dungeon.”</p>
    <p>…Really. If that person did not exist, the me right now would have already died. Just by imagining this, my spine trembled, followed by a strong feeling of urinating.</p>
    <p>I swore to my heart that I would absolutely never forget about the things that Eina had mentioned.</p>
    <p>“Fuu…Seems like you always have a fantasy regarding the dungeon. What you did today, I guess that is also the reason right?”</p>
    <p>“Ah ha ha…”</p>
    <p>Correct. I wanted to pursue an encounter with the opposite gender so I wanted to take a little bit of risk…But if I directly said it out, I will surely be hit.</p>
    <p>Originally, I wanted to become an adventurer only because I had always had an aspiration of having an encounter with beautiful girls I have never seen before —— Kind of like those hero comics where they have a fateful encounter——The motive was really that impure. Even when I was going through the procedures in the guild, Eina stared at me doubtfully for a while because she saw me exude a suspicious and passionate atmosphere, although she could not capture what I thought in my heart.</p>
    <p>But from today on, it is different. I want to completely throw away the impure motives, the reason for entering the dungeon will become very simple.</p>
    <p>That is to have an encounter with that person.</p>
    <p>“That…There is…The thing about Wallenstein…”</p>
    <p>“Ah…As a member of the guild, I cannot leak any adventurer’s information…But I can tell you what is already well-known by others.” She first gave off a short intro, then Eina began to speak. Somehow, it always feels that she was rather intimate. Perhaps it is because I am still a newcomer.</p>
    <p>Real Name, Aizu Wallenstein. A swordswomen. Core member of the &gt;Loki Family&lt;.</p>
    <p>Her swordplay is unmistakably at the peak of all the adventurers. She had wiped out a large group of LV. 5 monsters by herself. So amongst the adventurers, she also has a title, &lt;Sword Princess&gt;. It seems that name has also spread among the Gods, so she has also obtained the praise of &lt;Aizu is unparalleled in the world&gt;.</p>
    <p>She also taught a lesson to those approaching her with impure desires, or rather, she completely crushed them.</p>
    <p>At this point of time, it seems like she had broken the record of 1000 failed courtships.</p>
    <p>“What else is there? The rest is almost all about her appearance and looks.”</p>
    <p>“Isn’t that only from the perspective of an adventurer…how about her hobbies or favorite food, and there was something that you didn’t say…”</p>
    <p>Seeing my face turning red and hearing my timid voice, Eina’s eyes twinkled two or three times.</p>
    <p>“What, it can’t be that Bell-kun fell in love with Wallenstein right?”</p>
    <p>“No, Well…Ummm, Yes…”</p>
    <p>“Hahaah. You can’t help it. Even I from the same gender would sometimes freeze when I see her.”</p>
    <p>Eina gave a wry smile and lifted the red tea to her mouth. A sequential action, yet it was extremely elegant.</p>
    <p>This person, who praised Wallenstein, actually also had a high popularity among the adventurers.</p>
    <p>With gentle and crystal eyes, a pointed chin and a beautiful straight nose. She has all the conditions necessary for a beauty. It is said that there are many individuals that like her. When I knew that Eina was going to become my adviser, I was extremely happy.</p>
    <p>As a half-breed, she has the beauty of the elf’s typical appearance characteristics. But at the same time, she had an unexpected affinity for care. A lot of people have fallen for the error gap between this impression and reality.</p>
    <p>After Eina thought for a while, she said to my ear. “Wallenstein currently is not dating anyone.”</p>
    <p>I could not help but do a victory gesture.</p>
    <p>“About hobbies aside from <strong>that</strong>, I honestly have not heard anything regarding it…Ah ah. Nono. This is unrelated to my my service! I am not a love expert!”</p>
    <p>“J…Just what is <strong>that</strong>!”</p>
    <p>“No~! Okay, if there isn’t any problem, go back go back!”</p>
    <p>As if it was to get me out, Eina first stood up and urged me. My feeble protests completely did not work and the two of us returned to the guild’s hall.</p>
    <p>This hall that was built with white marble was very impressive. Right now there is almost no one here, there are only images of adventurers and gods on the wall that had a bit of existence.</p>
    <p>“Eina is really mean…”</p>
    <p>“This…You are currently an adventurer. There are still many, many things you have to pay attention to okay?”</p>
    <p>“Mmm…”</p>
    <p>About that, even I know about it.</p>
    <p>The current me won’t be able to protect anyone. In order to survive to the next day, there was no other way but to use this body and enter the dungeon. If I do not develop an awareness for saving money, it is not acceptable.</p>
    <p>For the people who may or may not have people to cherish…No, there is Kami-sama! In fact, I completely do not have the skill to feel strongly about the matter concerning about Wallenstein.</p>
    <p>“You have already obtained a &lt;Grace&gt; from a god besides from Loki. So if you were to get too close to her, who is a key member of the &lt;Loki Family&gt;, I would also be troubled.”</p>
    <p>“…Yes.”</p>
    <p>“…I’m not telling you to give up on your feelings. Just that you should have to look at the reality. If I don’t say this, it would be bad for Bell too.”</p>
    <p>The meaning behind those words is that from now on, I should also continue to work hard as an adventurer.</p>
    <p>Seeing my unwilling but surrendering face, Eina also returned to her role of a guild official and asked a question.</p>
    <p>“Exchanging gold?”</p>
    <p>“…Yes. At least before I met the Minotaur, I defeated some monsters.”</p>
    <p>“Then let’s go to the gold exchange. I’ll go with you.”</p>
    <p>Despite how annoyed I made her become, I still felt guilty deep inside. Although, I know that she did it for my own good as I did not understand much, but I think that it will be difficult to raise my head in front of Eina from now on.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, we went together to the gold exchange located inside the guild and obtained today’s rewards.</p>
    <p>The monsters that I primarily defeated were goblins and dryads, afterwards taking the magic stone piece from them. All together it exchanged into 1200 Varisu. It was considerably lower than an average income, but this is because I fled from Wallenstein, the time spent at the dungeon was also considerably shorter than usual.</p>
    <p>Ah, because of the cost of the repairs for my weapon and for the god and my own meal, even items can’t be replenished…</p>
    <p>“……Bell-kun”</p>
    <p>“Ah, yes. What is it?”</p>
    <p>Just when I was about to go back, Eina, who brought me to the entrance, told me to stop.</p>
    <p>She was hesitant, but afterwards, she seemed to have decided and began to speak.</p>
    <p>“About this, women will primarily think that a strong and reliable male has more charm…So, as long as you work hard, then…that…right?”</p>
    <p>“……”</p>
    <p>“……Wallenstein might also look at Bell who became stronger?”</p>
    <p>My actions suddenly stopped and, hearing this remark, I lifted my head and stared at Eina.</p>
    <p>Once I realized that she was not acting as a guild official, but rather as a friend encouraging me, I could not help but smile.</p>
    <div class="fullpage"><img src="http://solitarytranslation.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/01_021.jpg" /></div>
    <p>I quickly ran away from the place and immediately turned my heard around and yelled to Eina.</p>
    <p>“Eina, I love you!”</p>
    <p>“……Eh!?”</p>
    <p>“Thank you!”</p>
    <p>Once I saw that I made Eina blush, I smiled and entered the street crowd.</p>
    <p>The labyrinth city Orario.</p>
    <p>Not only does it have an underground maze known as a dungeon, above it was a huge city.</p>
    <p>The city, or rather a city that flourished because of the guild that managed the dungeon, had a variety of people living here, not only humans, but also other races.</p>
    <p>As for me who still had little understanding of the place, the explanation for Orario can only end here. Although I am a resident here, my level of knowledge about it is still not high.</p>
    <p>As for the people who enter the dungeon, and continue to gain revenue from there to sustain their livelihoods, they are called adventurers. It is also my current occupation.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a rural village not too far away from Orario, and can be regarded as someone who knows nothing about the world and after the death of my grandfather who raised me up, I had completely lost my guardian. So I took the remaining wealth and left the village.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, but you should already know the reason I left was because I wished to have a fateful encounter in the dungeon.</p>
    <p>&lt;——If you’re a male, you cannot not hope for a harem!&gt;</p>
    <p>When I was young, my grandfather would frequently say this sentence to my ear while having a hearty laugh, till now I can still remember it clearly.</p>
    <p>Since I began to understand things, I had always liked the hero stories that my grandfather told me about. Repelling monsters, saving others, and also rescuing the trapped princess. At that time, I really had these ideas and wanted to become the coolest hero.</p>
    <p>But, at that time, my grandfather told me.</p>
    <p>In those hero stories, the greatest interest resides in having an encounter with cute girls.</p>
    <p>However, at that time, it was still too early. The little me often dreamed to become a hero and also began to produce a passion to have an encounter with the opposite gender. My grandfather had also begun to instill what exactly is a &lt;Male’s Romance&gt;.</p>
    <p>As my age increased, I understood how great the existence of a hero is, and that my idea was just wishful thinking, so that dream slowly withered. What replaced it was the passion to succeed his idea, and this passion gradually increased.</p>
    <p>After being persuaded by my grandfather repeatedly, what became one of my favorite books was &lt;The Sacred Labyrinth Dungeon&gt; ——A book that records the heroic deeds from heroes within this labyrinth city. It is also possible that he bought this book to cultivate my passion.</p>
    <p>Placing myself into the gradually unfolding adventures and following the heroes……If I go to Orario, If I become an adventurer, If I enter the dungeon. Then at that time,wouldn’t I be able to become an hero, and be able to find my fateful encounter?</p>
    <p>At the time when I lost my only relative, I seemed to have been moved by his remaining thoughts and came to the place with a dungeon.</p>
    <p>At the beginning I was really still mindless, just like today and placed myself near death. I began to have an idea that my reason for coming here was really too stupid. Perhaps I am the only one who holds a playful reason to become an adventurer. Forget it, whether it is for wealth or for reputation, those people are all pursuing something, I did not feel that I was that different in nature.</p>
    <p>However, &lt;Survival&gt; is definitely difficult. After nearly dying today, I deeply understand this.</p>
    <p>No matter if it was the dungeon or for other things, you can’t consider it that simply.</p>
    <p>My goal has already changed from before, it now includes the thing about Aizu Wallenstein.</p>
    <p>In the overcrowded streets, all kind of races are there. I was working hard to walk through the cracks between people.</p>
    <p>Dwarves, Gnomes, Beastmen, Hobbits……there are some normal citizens, and also people wearing gorgeous equipment. To a person who grew up in a rural village, the streets were filled with freshness and beauty. Perhaps even just this simple crowd, I would not get tired of seeing it. Even this noisiness was a wonderful feeling in my heart.</p>
    <p>Although my eyes were completely stuck onto the cute elves’ bodies, I still remember my destination. Going past the busy street, I entered a narrow trial and turned a few corners.</p>
    <p>Once the noisiness completely disappeared from behind, I walked to the end of the road.</p>
    <p>“……”</p>
    <p>I raised my head to look at the building in front.</p>
    <p>What was constructed in the depth of this unpopular small road was a broken down church.</p>
    <p>You could also see that this two-story building that used to pay respects to gods was almost completely broken. From the appearance, there are traces of broken stone everywhere. It would easily make one feel that it has gone through many years and has disappeared from the memories of the people , this type of sadness.</p>
    <p>At the top of the front entrance, a statue of a goddess, with a tattered body and half her face missing, was smiling down at me.</p>
    <p>“Okay.”</p>
    <p>Although there is no need to confirm, but I still turned my head and looked if anyone was around. Then I immediately drilled in from the front entrance, and entered the inside of the Church. In fact, the front entrance did not have a door.</p>
    <p>The inner part of the building had a degree of destruction comparable to the outside. From the gap between the broken floors, dense weeds grew. Most of the ceiling had already fallen apart, it was equivalent to having none. From the big hole in the ceiling, the warm sunlight shone right through. It shone onto the altar that had managed to maintain its original appearance.</p>
    <p>This could be basically called a ruined church and I used the movement I learned to pass through it. I came in front of a small room in front of the altar and went in. There is a row of shelves without any books in this dimly lit room. Behind the innermost shelf was a ……ladder extending to the bottom.</p>
    <p>After going down this seemly bottomless ladder, a door appeared in front of my eyes, the door was open and from the tiny window on the door, a small light leaked out.</p>
    <p>“Kami-sama also came back! Ah I’m back.”</p>
    <p>I shouted while stepping into the door. What was in front of my eyes gave off a feeling that it was a small room in the basement. Inside there is the aura that someone lived here, but about the point for people living here, it seems like it was only one part of it.</p>
    <p>The person I called out to was seen once I entered the door. She was lying down on the purple sofa. With a position of lying on her back and holding a book in her hands. Once she heard my voice, she immediately stood up.</p>
    <p>If just by judging from the appearance it looks like a little girl… it should be considered between a little girl and a female teen. She was even shorter than me, so from other people’s perspectives, saying that she was my little sister who was almost the same age as me was not a problem.</p>
    <p>A smile emerged on the innocent girl’s face. With a sound “totototo” , she ran up in front of me.</p>
    <p>“Ahah you’ve returned. Aren’t you earlier than usual today?”</p>
    <p>“I nearly died in the dungeon…”</p>
    <p>“Hey Hey, are you alright? If you die I will be quite troubled. Perhaps it would be quite sad to say.”</p>
    <p>After saying this, her two small hands gently touched my hands. As if to confirm that I have not been injured.</p>
    <p>From her words, I could hear a hint of concern. I feel very happy about this and my face began to flush.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a problem. I will not let you be left on the street.”</p>
    <p>“Ah, you’ve said this before. If one day you decided to ride on a big boat, you must have prepared your resolve right?”</p>
    <p>“What kind of strange words are these…”</p>
    <p>The two of them laughed while conversing and entered the inside of the room.</p>
    <p>The inside of the room was composed of space made from a square and a rectangle. It just looks like the shape of the letter P. Near the door of the square section stood two sofas. I sat down with her.</p>
    <p>The girl facing me was undoubtedly a beautiful girl. Her sleek black hair just covered her ears and she tied a pony tail on both sides. What was used to tie her hair was a silver bell. A round head and a round face, it made her appearance seem quite immature. But perhaps because of this, the contrast between her face and her upper part of her clothing made her mature boobs more noticeable.</p>
    <p>Her round eyes revealed a blue light. That perfect body will always make people have a dreamy atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Although I can definitely guarantee that she would become a peerless beauty in the future, she cannot get rid of her current appearance.</p>
    <p>Kami-sama, just as I called her, this person is a &lt;God&gt;</p>
    <p>A different being compared to humans, demi-humans and monsters that appear in the dungeon, she is an existence that is in a different dimension compared to us. They are different from us in how our appearance changes as our age increases. It is completely beyond our cognition, an existence that is greater than the hero that I had envisioned.</p>
    <p>“In that case, today you basically have no harvest?”</p>
    <p>“A little less than usual. Kami-sama, what about you”</p>
    <p>“Oho, Look at this! Tada</p>
    <p>“T…This is!?”</p>
    <p>“Because I made a lot of small contributions to the store’s revenue, so I got a lot of potato croquettes! Today’s dinner is a feast of potato croquettes. Fufu, Bell-kun, you won’t be sleeping today right?”</p>
    <p>“Kami-sama, you’re the best.”</p>
    <p>This great existence was also working in a human shop. Of course, it was to earn money and making a living for tomorrow.</p>
    <p>——A long time ago, &lt;The Gods&gt; descended to our world……According to their words, it was a place called &lt;Lower World&gt;. Although there are many explanations about this out there, but based on the words of the god in front of me, it was because “Heaven was too boring, so there’s no helping it”.</p>
    <p>We, who are trying to ascend to heaven, generally see it as paradise. However, the gods were already tired of living an eternal life. So in order to get rid of their boredom, they went to find some fun with the culturally prosperous “children” – which means us, who lived in the Lower World.</p>
    <p>&lt;To stand in the same position and have the same abilities as the children, in order to see things from their perspective&gt; They are a perfect existence, so that’s why they are not perfect. For them who are bored, this world was filled with interesting things.</p>
    <p>As a result, the Lower World made the gods extremely excited. The satisfaction from Unpredictable events, Food, Interest and Arts, and the other many special interactions.</p>
    <p>They were able to smile while being satisfied.</p>
    <p>Although it feels like the Gods are just playing a game, but during the time, when they cannot predict the end results, they really really enjoyed it.</p>
    <p>The Gods have not yet lived long in the Lower World. However, it seems that many gods have decided to live here permanently.</p>
    <p>The Lower World residents of that time, or our ancestors, did not refuse and didn’t have any dissatisfaction. Because they obtained a &lt;Grace&gt; from the gods, so they feel as if they had found a treasure. Although the explanation was like this, wasn’t it actually a relationship of using and being used? The current structure clearly demonstrates this relationship. They are mixed with the children and like us, they help each other daily and strive to survive.</p>
    <p>And saying goodbye to their boring and trapped lives, the Gods have already completely penetrated into this world.</p>
    <p>“Ah, come to think of it……Even though everyone say I am extremely cute as mascot character, there is still no one who wants to enter my &lt;Familia&gt;. They all say: “I’ve never even heard of the name Hestia.” These people are all so calculating.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, originally, no matter which Familia gives the Grace, it is all the same……”</p>
    <p>The God in front of my eyes is called &lt;Hestia&gt;. Gods like her all have children bear their own title.</p>
    <p>To be accurate, a &lt;God’s Familia&gt; is a faction of the god. &lt;Loki’s Family&gt; means &lt;Goddess Loki’s Familia&gt;, &lt;Hestia’s Family&gt; is &lt;Goddess Hestia’s Familia&gt; Of course, there are people who refer to it as faction so it is called Loki’s faction and Hestia’s faction.</p>
    <p>From what I feel, joining a family is equivalent to becoming a family member to the god.</p>
    <p>Although Gods decided to live with us from the Lower World ——There was a rule that stated that Gods cannot use their almighty &lt;Godly Power&gt; in the Lower World before. ——But food and living standards all require money.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are a few Gods that enjoy to work, but most Gods still like to simply enjoy themselves. These Gods, in order to continue their carefree living style, lend their power to people from the Lower World.</p>
    <p>After joining a family, they will give &lt;Grace&gt; to the people from the Lower World.</p>
    <p>Then those individuals would have to meet the requests of the Gods, and help the Gods earn money.</p>
    <p>In other words, if we unfold those words, Gods are supported by their family members.</p>
    <p>However, we cannot completely ignore the benefits from the &lt;Grace&gt;. Just by accepting it once, no matter what kind of people, they will all be able to repel the lower level monsters in the dungeon.</p>
    <p>According to Hestia’s words, it is a &lt;Equivalent Exchange&gt;.</p>
    <p>“Ah, making Bell-kun take the burden alone, I really am quite sorry about it……”</p>
    <p>“I’m okay……Kami-sama, you, too, have been working hard.”</p>
    <p>If they are large families with lots of members, then, of course, there also exist weak families like ours.</p>
    <p>If it was like that, even Gods have no other choice……They must work hard like Hestia. There is no time or chance for them to enjoy the things they like, and could only simply focus on surviving.</p>
    <p>In that case, what else can they do……They could only mix with the crowd of people from the Lower World. But for such a God, I also could not help but become fond and intimate with her.</p>
    <p>Yes. But among the Gods, there are some that control their family like a empire——It was more proper to say that they developed their own family into a empire……As if they pretend it as a managing empire game?</p>
    <p>But, because this was managed and created by others, so it is not considered to have betrayed the rules between Gods. Of course there are people who speak behind their backs and say that Gods are playing around with the people of the Lower World based on their own personalities, but there are some people who also wanted to be part of the royal family.</p>
    <p>Although Gods enjoy to smile and watch at the complicated and staggering matters of humans, in terms of promotion, they basically were useless.</p>
    <p>“……Sorry, I made you contract with such an incompetent god.”</p>
    <p>“Kami-sami, you…”</p>
    <p>Seeing the weak and tiny god, I could not help but say it out loud.</p>
    <p>My encounter with Hestia occurred shortly after I came over from the rural village and about to become an Adventurer, it was when I was mindlessly walked around the street where they recruit Familia members.</p>
    <p>The famous Familias are already saturated with numerous members, and the small and medium-sized Familias would always select those people with some experience in battle or other occupations first compared to me, who had just came from a rural village and did not know anything and even required care from others. I , who received many cold shoulders, eventually received an invitation from Kami-sama and did not hesitate to follow her.</p>
    <p>Kami-sama might think that she had created a psychological burden, because she seems to have a feeling that she had abducted a child who did not know anything.</p>
    <p>According to Hestia, she had only recently descended down from heaven, and was at her friend’s Familia before meeting me. Just like most of the other gods, she also enjoys to play around over and over again, and indulges herself in the books from the Lower World. Because she had always lived a sloppy life, on the contrary, it seems that her diligent friend was being used. The room located underneath the church was that friend’s final friendship.</p>
    <p>But in reality, there is essentially no difference between a God’s Grace , this is a fact.</p>
    <p>After receiving the Grace, no matter who, all start off from the same starting point.</p>
    <p>The development afterwards is completely based on the individual’s situation.</p>
    <p>That is to mean for the Familia, it was similar to the shop and empires, it was based on the member’s individual’s ability. It was absolutely not because Kami-sama was incompetent.</p>
    <p>“Don’t let it bother you Kami-sama! Our Familia is still in the beginning stages, it’s still developing. Although at the beginning it may be indeed difficult, but as long as we get through this, our life will become better. At that time, we will also have free time and people will come and join us!”</p>
    <p>“Bell-kun, you…!”</p>
    <p>And there you have it! I stood up from the couch while I was talking. From Kami-sama’s hopeful eyes, I can tell that she was completely moved by me. But in reality all this was what I’ve recently heard from Eina. So my heart felt sore.</p>
    <p>But no matter what, I still wanted to make Kami-sama a little bit happy.</p>
    <p>At that time I was dreaming of a harem, but in reality, when I came to the city I was completely lost, and it was Kami-sama who gently extended her hand to me. She is very important to me. I wanted to help this goddess.</p>
    <p>This promise that I made the instant I encountered her was deeply engraved into my heart. It was also my first promise I made to myself.</p>
    <p>“Oh, oh, to have an encounter with such a person must be my fortune. Then, for our future, let us first update your &lt;Status&gt;!”</p>
    <p>“Okay!”</p>
    <p>Kami-sama also stood up from the sofa. Those boobs, that did not match her tiny body, slightly shook. I was suddenly frozen for a bit, and allowed myself to smile, then I immediately turned away. Since I’m a shy person, the impact was too much for me.</p>
    <p>It seems that the other Gods sometimes joke around and call her &lt;Loli Big Boobs&gt;. What could “Loli” mean…</p>
    <p>“Then, as usual, take off your clothes and lie down.”</p>
    <p>“Understood.”</p>
    <p>While heading to the bed inside the room, I removed the light helm that adventurers use, then I removed my top underwear. What was on my upper body was completed taken off. Afterwards I tilted my head to look behind.</p>
    <p>The wall had a mirror. What the mirror reflected was my figure with elderly white hair and the light skin color. What was particularly striking was the black text  engraved on my back.</p>
    <p>These are all things that Hestia engraved on my body. This is the God’s Grace ——A Gift from God.</p>
    <p>“Okay, Okay, lie down, lie down.”</p>
    <p>After hearing Kami-sama hurrying me, I relaxed my entire body.</p>
    <p>Once I lied down on my stomach, Kami-sama jumped up and sat on my waist.</p>
    <p>“Anyway, you just said that you nearly died, what exactly happened?”</p>
    <p>“It will take a while to explain it……”</p>
    <p>When I began to explain, Kami-sama kept on touching my back. Once, twice, she went over the same places over and over again, as if she was telling me to relax, and gently stroked it.</p>
    <p>Then I heard a metallic sound. That was Kami-sama taking the needle out.</p>
    <p>I lifted my head slightly, turned back and looked. Kami-sama first used the needle to pierce her fingertips, then she let the blood flow out and drip slowly down onto my back.</p>
    <p>The red blood that landed on my skin spread like a ripple and completely entered my back.</p>
    <p>“You went down to a lower floor in order to have an encounter……Your fantasy about the dungeon really is amazing. Anyway, in such a messy location, it is impossible to have an encounter with the kind of pure and innocent girl you imagine.”</p>
    <p>“Innocent girl….! If there isn’t one, then wouldn’t there be no hope for the others? I mean, I’ve heard that elves do not even hold hands with others if they do not approve of them!”</p>
    <p>“Don’t yell now. Although there are races that are similar to the elves, there are also races like Amazons that would give their bodies to strong males for strong children. Also, I believe that those with your unrealistic way of thinking would eventually come to a bad end.”</p>
    <p>“……Yes.”</p>
    <p>After being informed of these heavy matters, I buried my head into the pillow. At the same time, on my back, Kami-sama used the spot that the blood had dripped down onto as the center, and painted her fingers. From the left side, she began to apply additional engravings.</p>
    <p>Now, what was engraved on my back is the &lt;Status&gt; ——it is also a &lt;God’s Grace&gt;.</p>
    <p>Kami-sama used the sacred text and engraved it on my back, using her blood as a medium. This is a power that only Gods have and can greatly improve the ability of the target. Of course, there are also things like &lt;Experience Points&gt;. Those are gained through experiencing a variety of events so, just like their name implies, they are based on your own experiences in life.</p>
    <p>Of course this is not visible, nor could it be created by hands of a Lower World human. If we need to explain it, it is equivalent of the history of your own experiences. Gods would take the event hidden in the history, let’s say &lt;Defeating monsters&gt;, extract it out, and allow it to become food for growth.</p>
    <p>The value of completed events in quantity and quality is the &lt;Experience Points&gt;.</p>
    <p>To Gods, these are visible and can be controlled. Perhaps it is similar to the ancient rituals, that is after defeating enemies, you would be able to get praises and blessings.</p>
    <p>Once the sacred text on my back has a sufficient amount of &lt;Experience Points&gt;, a Level Up happens and the ability values rise.</p>
    <p>This power is basically what the Gods gave to the Lower World humans.</p>
    <p>“Also there is the one called Aizu Wallenstein? That beautiful, yet strong girl must have lots of males that like her. If I was her, there would be many males in my surroundings.”</p>
    <p>“How could it be……”</p>
    <p>“Fuu. Okay, Bell-kun. Just give up on that momentary infatuation. Pay more attention to your surroundings please. There must be beautiful and gentle people that care about you around.”</p>
    <p>I was blamed for thinking of things that I should not have thought of, and I immediately began to cry. Kami-sama began to continuous scold Wallenstein. I thought that her mood was good, so could it be that I stepped on a landmine?</p>
    <p>Kami-sama said this, but the only females around me are Eina and Kami-sama herself. Eina will most definitely not accept me, as for Kami-sama ,who is an eternal existence,……Forget it, even if you tear my mouth off, I will not be willing to say it. It’s completely impossible for Kami-sama to be my partner.</p>
    <p>And Eina had always said this: Gods are all realistic and cold.</p>
    <p>“Once she became a member of Loki’s Familia, you became unable to marry Wallen-whatever.”</p>
    <p>“……”</p>
    <p>She directly hit the mark.</p>
    <p>Overall, people who joined a Familia can freely choose to marry within their Familia. But let’s say that you married a person from another Familia and had a child. Which Familia would the child belong to?</p>
    <p>Although that is a special case and is not all, but if you maintain a overly close relationship with another faction, it can easily cause abuse. In order to regulate the rules, Gods’ management of their Familia is very strict.</p>
    <p>Also, if the Gods themselves have a poor relationship, and had a hostile relationship with the other Familia, then they will not allow their members to bring danger to their Familia.</p>
    <p>Although Eina had also advised me, if I, from the Hestia Familia, and Wallenstein, from the Loki Familia, wanted to date each other, there will be a lot of difficulties in the middle.</p>
    <p>“Okay, I’ll put it bluntly. Forget about that girl, and look for your encounter in the vicinity.”</p>
    <p>“……Kami-sama, you’re so mean.”</p>
    <p>Ah, I won’t give up. Although I have not done anything, perhaps it is that nothing hasn’t been done. So I haven’t been disappointed yet.</p>
    <p>My relationship with that person hasn’t been developed yet.</p>
    <p>I renewed my resolve again and put on my clothes. At the same time, Kami-sama wrote down the status on the prepared paper. Because I basically do not understand the sacred text, Kami-sama used the language from the Lower World and wrote it down to tell me the details easily.</p>
    <p>Also, it’s difficult to see words written on one’s back.</p>
    <p>“Now, Look. Your new status.”</p>
    <p>After saying my thanks, I caught the paper that was handed to me. My gaze immediately fell onto it.</p>
    <p>Bell Cranel</p>
    <p>Lv. 1</p>
    <p>Strength: <strong>I 77 —> I 82</strong> Endurance: <strong>I 13</strong> Dexterity: <strong>I 93 —> I96</strong> Agility: <strong>H 148 —> H 172</strong> Magic: <strong>I 0</strong></p>
    <p>&lt;Magic&gt;</p>
    <p>[]</p>
    <p>&lt;Skill&gt;</p>
    <p>[]</p>
    <p>This was a summary of my status that was recorded on my back.</p>
    <p>The general abilities have five categories — the categories are strength, endurance, dexterity, agility and magic — each category is represented by ten stages from high to low S, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. The higher the stage, the more powerful your ability is.</p>
    <p>The number besides I is the proficiency value. 0~99 is I, 100~199 is H, Generally it is to link the specified formula to basic ability’s rank. Also there is a upper limit of 999. The more effort you place on a category, the faster the proficiency rate goes up, working hard to achieve the maximum value 999——which is also the S rank ability so it isn’t a bad thing.</p>
    <p>Lv is the most important. Even if it is just an increase of one level, your basic abilities will be greatly enhanced. It can also be said to be a huge enhancement mentally and physically. The current Lv 1 and Lv2 have a gap of immense power. So that’s why the chaotic Lv 2 Minotaur caused me, a Lv 1, so much trouble.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, you become stronger when your level goes up.</p>
    <p>Kami-sama called a &lt;Class Upgrade&gt;</p>
    <p>…Eh? This time dungeon exploration increased my strength, dexterity and agility… And agility increased that much! ? From H 148 it increased to H 172, so I gained 24 points?!”</p>
    <p>Could it be because I was running everywhere to escape from the Minotaur……?</p>
    <p>The proficiency system is simple: if you do not use a related ability, that basic ability will not increase. Example given: endurance. If I wanted to increase its proficiency, I would need to withstand the enemy’s attacks. I always avoid my enemy’s attacks, so this will basically almost never go up.</p>
    <p>Although using a weapon or a defensive gear to block the attack will also count, but no matter what I will still try to avoid it. Because it hurts!</p>
    <p>“……Kami-sama. When do you think I’ll be able to use magic?”</p>
    <p>“About this I’m not too sure. It seems to be based on &lt;Experience Points&gt; related to Cognition……Anyways, Bell-kun, you don’t read books right?”</p>
    <p>“Yes……”</p>
    <p>From the &lt;Status&gt; Kami-sama engraved, what everyone cares about should be whether they can use &lt;Magic&gt;.</p>
    <p>Before the Gods descended to the Lower World, Magic was a privilege of certain races. But there are also people who have never accepted a God’s gift but still discovered they could use magic.</p>
    <p>At least one, at most three, there is a fixed number of how many magics they can discover. Being able to use one is average, but if you can use two or more magics you usually get quite popular.</p>
    <p>Not only this, the existence of magic itself is very important. There is a legend that long ago, a wind elf controlled magic and mowed down hundreds of people. In short, magic is a trump card. It is an ultimate skill that can reverse a situation.</p>
    <p>Generally, if they are able to release a wave of flames, even if their enemy works hard and swings his sword to attack, they would not have any chance of victory. This is the base of the concept of ‘Magic’.</p>
    <p>I confirmed the &lt;Status&gt;, there was nothing inside the magic section, so naturally I cannot use any magic……?</p>
    <p>“Kami-sama, what about this skill section? It feels like it has been wiped……”</p>
    <p>“……Ahhhh, just now my hand slipped. It was blank as usual, don’t worry.”</p>
    <p>“So that’s what happened…”</p>
    <p>Basically I had some expectations.</p>
    <p>&lt;Skills&gt; and &lt;Status&gt; values are slightly different, they are special effects that are placed onto the body under certain conditions. If &lt;Status&gt; represents the strengthening of the body, &lt;Skills&gt; is the special reactions happening within the body.</p>
    <p>Although it isn’t like magic where you can see how amazing it is, the discovery of a &lt;Skill&gt; is a lot more rare……No, there are almost none.</p>
    <p>After confirming the updated &lt;Status&gt; again, I looked at the clock on the wall, then I turned my head towards Kami-sama.</p>
    <p>“Well, Kami-sama. Should we prepare for dinner? Even though it is a potato croquettes feast, we should not only eat just this right?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, then I’ll leave it to you, Bell-kun.”</p>
    <p>“Okay.”</p>
    <p>Giving Kami-sama a slight smile, I turned away and headed towards the kitchen. Although I can only make simple dishes. Yes, just like Eina said, from now on I must consider money issues … … .</p>
    <p>I felt that Kami-sama’s gaze was still glued onto my back, so I suddenly felt confident about saving money for the future.</p>
    <p class="centered">× × ×</p>
    <p>Hestia watched as Bell-kun entered the kitchen battlefield, and quietly adjusted her breath.</p>
    <p>Placing the &lt;Status&gt; she had written in her hand and comparing it with the one on the boy’s back.</p>
    <p>(These children really change easily…It is completely different from us who won’t change)</p>
    <p>Even if it was just a small change, it will still create an impact. It will spread from the physical body and mental state and flow outwards.</p>
    <p>It was neither desire or culture. &lt;Change&gt;, this was the essence of the residents from the Lower World.</p>
    <p>(……Ah, no no! I cannot accept that he has begun to change because of others, I absolutely do not want to admit that!)</p>
    <p>Hestia’s two hands made her dark hair all messy.</p>
    <p>It is too much ——After Hestia’s two hands held onto her head, she once again looked at Bell’s back.</p>
    <p>Correctly speaking, it should be looking at the back’s engraved &lt;Status&gt; —— at its &lt;Skills&gt; window.</p>
